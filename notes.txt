bio - basic i/o system
- bio-mem - mem buffer
- bio-dgram - takes a file handle to dgram sock
- etc

openssl.ssl.ctx_new("DTLS")
- initialize with dtls method

context has a set of methods
- .ssl
- - takes a pair of bios, recv and send
- - call read and write methods, it'll do state machine stuff and call bios
- - - if doing with mem, need to implement passing around
- - - if doing with dgram, need to implement polling for readiness

todo: expect specific server key
